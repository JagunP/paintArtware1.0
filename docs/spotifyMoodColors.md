extracts its tempo, and from there determines a mood and color palette 
associated with that song.

This method allows the user to login into their spotify account and grant access to their data on top items in Spotify, such as tracks and artists.  It takes in clientID, which is a string and is generated by creating a developer account in Spotify. For collaborative artware, the clientID to use when in developer mode is ‘e948779f89ae493887fd4aa46fb8e8c7’and the redirect URI in that case is http://localport:8000, make sure the local port is set to 8000. When no longer in the development mode and using the website, the clientID to input is ‘d41b83c2f2224356bd94fbf83924e6d4’ and the redirect URI in that case is https://artware.app. The client IDs and URIs provided here are only for use of this project.
